## Project Architecture

**Luminari's Quest** is a therapeutic AI-powered RPG built with React, TypeScript, and Supabase. The application helps young adults process trauma through interactive storytelling and journaling.  The primary tool required for building this project is the "Bolt.new" platform.

### Core Architecture

- **Frontend Stack**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI components
- **State Management**: Zustand with persistence for game state
- **Backend**: Supabase for authentication and data storage
- **AI Services**: OpenAI for narrative generation, Leonardo.AI for images, ElevenLabs for voice
- **Routing**: React Router with protected routes for authenticated content

### Key Application Structure

The app follows a single-page application pattern with these main routes:
- `/` - Home/landing page with authentication
- `/adventure` - Main gameplay interface (protected)
- `/progress` - Progress tracking and journal entries (protected)
- `/profile` - User account management (protected)
- `/legal` - Legal information and compliance

### Game State Management

Game state is managed through `src/store/game-store.ts` using Zustand with persistence:

- **Guardian Trust System**: Core mechanic tracking player's bond with their guardian spirit (0-100)
- **Journal Entries**: Therapeutic reflections triggered by milestones and learning moments
- **Milestones**: Achievement system based on trust levels (25, 50, 75)
- **Scene History**: Completed gameplay scenarios with outcomes
- **Hydration Safety**: Prevents SSR/client mismatches with `_hasHydrated` flag

### Scene Engine

The therapeutic gameplay is driven by `src/engine/scene-engine.ts`:

- **Scene Types**: social, skill, combat, journal, exploration
- **Dice Mechanics**: d20 system with difficulty classes (DC)
- **Choice System**: Bold vs cautious decision-making paths
- **Trust Modulation**: Outcomes affect guardian trust levels

### Component Architecture

- **Layout System**: Responsive layout with sidebar navigation (`src/components/layout/`)
- **Authentication**: Supabase-based auth with protected routes (`src/components/auth/`)
- **Game Components**: 
  - `ChoiceList` - Main gameplay interface
  - `GuardianText` - Dynamic guardian spirit messaging
  - `JournalModal` - Therapeutic reflection prompts
  - `StatsBar` - Progress visualization
- **UI Components**: Comprehensive Radix UI component library (`src/components/ui/`)

### Data Flow

1. **Authentication**: Supabase handles user auth and session management
2. **Game State**: Zustand store persists locally and syncs with Supabase (planned)
3. **Scene Progression**: Linear scene progression with persistent choice outcomes
4. **Trust System**: Player choices modify guardian trust, triggering milestones
5. **Journaling**: Milestone achievements and learning moments prompt reflective writing

### Environment Configuration

Required environment variables (see `.env.example`):
- Supabase configuration
- AI service API keys (OpenAI, Leonardo.AI, ElevenLabs)
- Application URLs and deployment settings

### Development Standards

- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier configuration for consistent formatting
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing with separate tsconfig files for app and build tools
- **Testing**: Vitest with React Testing Library
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom component variants
- **Error Handling**: Error boundaries and graceful fallbacks throughout the application

### Legal Compliance

The project includes Open Gaming License (OGL) compliance for RPG mechanics and therapeutic content guidelines. See `licenses/` directory for full licensing details.
