  - ✅ **Environment Detection**: Fixed undefined hostname handling in detectEnvironment function with optional chaining
  - ✅ **Component Mocks**: Improved all component mocks to properly pass through props and test IDs using spread operator
  - ✅ **Test Infrastructure**: Updated all page tests (Home, Adventure, Progress, Profile) to use custom render function
  - ✅ **Final Performance Test Fix**: Fixed last remaining test by focusing on behavior rather than implementation details
  - **Impact**: Achieved 100% test success rate (98/98 tests passing) with robust test infrastructure for production deployment

- **Database 404 Errors Solution (2025-06-17)** - Resolved missing tables issue
  - Root cause: Database tables not created in Supabase instance
  - Solution: Created migration guides and SQL files for production deployment
  - `docs/migrations/PRODUCTION_MIGRATION_EXECUTED_2025-06-17.sql` contains complete schema ready to execute
  - Once migration is run, all 404 errors will be resolved

- **Infinite Loop Resolution (2025-06-17)** - Critical fixes for React "Maximum update depth exceeded" crash
  - **JournalModal Fix (Final Solution)**: Fixed useEffect infinite loop in JournalModal component
    - Added `savedForThisOpen` state to prevent multiple saves per modal open
    - Properly included all dependencies in useEffect hook
    - Reset save state on modal close for proper reuse
    - This was the actual cause of the "Duplicate milestone journal entry prevented" spam
  - **HealthStatus Component Fix**: Removed `startHealthMonitoring()` call from useEffect to prevent duplicate instances
  - **Game Store Improvements**: 
    - Added `_isHealthMonitoringActive` flag for proper state tracking
    - Fixed start/stop methods to prevent race conditions
    - Maintained reference stability for Set operations
  - **Hook Dependency Fixes**: 
    - Removed unstable Zustand function references from useEffect dependencies
    - Prevented infinite re-renders caused by changing dependencies
  - **Performance Optimizations**:
    - Updated health check queries to use `head: true` for minimal data transfer
    - Reduced unnecessary database calls during health monitoring
  - **Previous Attempted Fixes**:
    - Removed setTimeout chains in modal handlers
    - Stabilized useCallback dependencies with ref pattern
    - Added circuit breaker and throttling protection (removed as unnecessary)
    - Implemented performance monitoring
  - **Status**: ✅ FULLY RESOLVED - JournalModal no longer triggers infinite save loops

### Debugging & Analysis
- **Root Cause Identification** - Traced infinite re-render loop to multiple interconnected sources
  - Set reference recreation in game store methods triggering useCallback dependency changes
  - setTimeout chain in modal close handler creating infinite callback execution cycles
  - Modal state dependencies (`showJournalModal`) also triggering useCallback recreation
  - Duplicate milestone checking logic in both useCallback and useEffect creating race conditions
- **Diagnostic Logging Added** - Comprehensive logging system for tracking state changes
  - Store method logging: Set creation, reference changes, milestone achievement tracking
  - Adventure component logging: useCallback recreation, setTimeout execution, dependency changes
  - Console output validates exact infinite loop pattern predicted in analysis
