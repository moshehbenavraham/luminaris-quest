 * @param scene - The scene being processed
 * @param success - Whether the player succeeded in the challenge
 * @param roll - The dice roll result (optional)
 * @returns Complete scene outcome with all effects

 * const scene = getScene(0);
 * const diceResult = rollDice(scene.dc);
 * const outcome = handleSceneOutcome(scene, diceResult.success, diceResult.roll);
 * 
 * if (outcome.triggeredCombat) {
