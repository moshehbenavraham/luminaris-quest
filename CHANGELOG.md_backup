## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **🔴 CRITICAL FIX: Combat Action Execution Bug** (June 24, 2025) - Fixed critical bug where combat actions weren't executing properly
  - **Issue**: Combat actions (ILLUMINATE, REFLECT, ENDURE, EMBRACE) were only incrementing turn counter without applying effects

  - Updated `useCombat.test.ts` mock to return `{ canPerform: boolean }` structure
  - Verified end-to-end combat flow: Adventure → Failed Roll → Combat UI → Player Actions → Victory/Defeat → Reflection
  - Confirmed all 4 shadow types (doubt, isolation, overwhelm, pastPain) work correctly in combat
  - Validated resource system integration (LP/SP rewards applied after combat)
  - Verified therapeutic reflection system integration
  - **Impact**: Combat system now fully functional with proper test coverage

  - **Impact**: Resolved critical implementation gap concern - combat system is fully functional and ready for end-to-end testing
  - **Root Cause Resolution**: No fundamental implementation gap exists - combat UI interaction works correctly
  - **Next Phase**: Ready for Phase 4 end-to-end integration testing and validation

### Fixed
- **Combat System Integration**: Fixed critical issue where combat encounters were not properly triggering the CombatOverlay UI

  - **Solution**: Updated `startCombat` to use `createShadowManifestation()` function to create proper shadow enemies
  - **Impact**: Combat encounters now properly initialize with correct shadow data, HP, abilities, and therapeutic insights
  - **Testing**: Added comprehensive unit tests to verify shadow manifestation creation and combat trigger integration
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `src/store/game-store.ts`: Updated startCombat function and added import for createShadowManifestation
    - `src/__tests__/scene-engine-integration.test.ts`: Added Combat Trigger Integration Fix test suite
  - **Breaking Changes**: None - this is a bug fix that restores intended functionality
  - **Version Impact**: Patch-level fix (no API changes)

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL FIX: StatsBar Display Logic During Hydration** - Fixed a critical issue where the StatsBar component would not display combat resources (Light Points and Shadow Points) during the hydration phase. The problem was that the hydration-safe hook was returning hardcoded initial values (0) instead of the actual store values, preventing the stats bar from appearing even when players had earned resources. This fix ensures that combat resources are displayed in real-time, allowing players to see their progress immediately after completing scenes.
  - Modified `useGameStore` hydration logic to use actual store values for `lightPoints` and `shadowPoints`
  - Updated combat state to use real store values during hydration

    - handleSceneOutcome function properly calculates resource changes for different scene types
    - Combat scene trigger logic working correctly for failed combat encounters
    - Resource reward calculation functioning as expected (3 LP for social, 2 LP for skill, 4 LP for combat, etc.)
  - ✅ **Resource Application Flow Analysis**: Systematic debugging approach to identify resource application gaps
    - Added logging at the exact point where modifyLightPoints and modifyShadowPoints are called
    - Enhanced scene outcome object logging to track triggeredCombat status and resource changes
    - Prepared foundation for identifying whether issue is in resource calculation, application, or display
  - **Impact**: Provides detailed visibility into resource application process to diagnose why LP/SP rewards are not appearing in stats bar
