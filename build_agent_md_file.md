# The Ultimate Guide to Creating a High-Performance `.agent.md` Memory File for Atlassian Rovo Dev CLI

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive guide synthesizes cutting-edge research on Atlassian's Rovo Dev CLI memory system to help you create an optimal `.agent.md` file. This memory file serves as a persistent knowledge base that enables the AI agent to understand your project context, maintain coding standards, and evolve with your codebase over time .

## Understanding Rovo Dev CLI's Memory Architecture

Atlassian's Rovo Dev CLI implements a sophisticated adaptive memory system that fundamentally transforms how AI agents interact with your codebase . Unlike stateless AI assistants, Rovo Dev creates persistent, evolving knowledge networks that grow with your project, following principles similar to the Zettelkasten method for knowledge management.

### Core Memory System Components

The memory system operates on four interconnected levels:

1. **Session Memory**: Immediate context for current tasks
2. **Project Memory**: Persistent knowledge about architecture and patterns
3. **Behavioral Memory**: Learned preferences and team conventions
4. **Evolutionary Memory**: Dynamic updates based on new interactions
