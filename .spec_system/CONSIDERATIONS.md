## Active Concerns

Items requiring attention in upcoming phases. Review before each session.

### Technical Debt

<!-- Max 5 items -->

_None yet - add items as technical debt accumulates._

### External Dependencies

<!-- Max 5 items -->

- Supabase PostgreSQL with RLS - core data layer

### Performance / Security

<!-- Max 5 items -->

- RLS policies must be audited for security
- Database query performance should be monitored

### Architecture

<!-- Max 5 items -->

- Zustand store with persistence middleware for state management
- Auto-save system with debounced saves every 30 seconds

---

## Lessons Learned

Proven patterns and anti-patterns. Reference during implementation.

### What Worked

<!-- Max 15 items -->

- Selective Zustand subscriptions for performance
- Hydration safety pattern for SSR compatibility
- Co-located tests with source files

### What to Avoid

<!-- Max 10 items -->

- Using `any` types without justification
- Components over 250 lines (500 for combat system)
- Direct store usage without hydration check

### Tool/Library Notes

<!-- Max 5 items -->

- React 19.2 requires stricter testing patterns (wrap timer advances in act())
- Radix UI components need 2000ms timeout in tests

## Resolved

Recently closed items (buffer - rotates out after 2 phases).
