- Learning about system evolution
- Audit trails and compliance

**❌ Archived docs should NOT be used for:**
- Current development guidance (may be outdated)
- Implementation reference (use current docs instead)
- Production deployment (use current deployment guide)
- API reference (use current API documentation)

### Accuracy Warning

**These documents may contain:**
- Outdated information
- References to deprecated features
- Obsolete implementation details
- Incorrect assumptions
- Broken links to moved files

**Always verify against current codebase and active documentation!**

## 📜 Document Retention Policy

### Why We Archive

Instead of deleting old documentation, we archive it because:

1. **Historical Value:** Shows how the project evolved
2. **Problem-Solving Reference:** Past solutions may inform future decisions
3. **Audit Trail:** Maintains record of decisions and changes
4. **Learning Resource:** Examples of documentation and approaches
5. **Compliance:** Some organizations require document retention

### What Gets Archived

Documents are archived when they:

- ✅ Describe completed one-time tasks (bug fixes, migrations)
- ✅ Are superseded by newer documentation
- ✅ Contain duplicate information now consolidated elsewhere
- ✅ Are specific to temporary situations or platforms
- ✅ Are marketing materials rather than technical docs
- ✅ Belong in code comments rather than standalone files

### What Stays Active

Documents remain active when they:

- ✅ Describe current features and architecture
- ✅ Provide essential guides for users or developers
- ✅ Document current APIs and interfaces
- ✅ Offer troubleshooting for current issues
- ✅ Guide ongoing development and contributions

---

## 🔄 Unarchiving Documents

If an archived document becomes relevant again:

1. **Verify Accuracy:** Check against current codebase
2. **Update Content:** Correct outdated information
3. **Move to Active Docs:** Place in appropriate active folder
4. **Update Links:** Ensure all references are current
5. **Announce Change:** Note in changelog or team communication

---

## 📝 Archive Maintenance

### Regular Reviews

The archive is reviewed periodically to:

- Ensure archived docs are still relevant to keep
- Remove truly obsolete documents after sufficient time
- Update this README with accurate status information
- Verify links and metadata

### Contributing to Archive

If you find documentation that should be archived:

1. **Verify it's truly obsolete:** Check with maintainers
2. **Extract any unique value:** Merge useful info into active docs
3. **Move to archive:** Use git mv to preserve history
4. **Update this README:** Add entry with proper metadata
5. **Update links:** Ensure no broken links in active docs

See [Contributing Guide](../contributing/index.md) for process details.

---

## 🗑️ Permanent Deletion

Documents may be permanently deleted from the archive after:

- Sufficient time has passed (typically 1+ year)
- No historical value identified
- Content is truly obsolete with no reference value
- Team consensus on deletion

**Note:** Git history still preserves deleted files for long-term historical reference.
