# Luminari's Quest - Task List

## ⚠️ CRITICAL COMBAT SYSTEM ISSUES ⚠️

**IMPORTANT**: The combat system implementation was "completed" on June 23-24, 2025 (see CHANGELOG.md), but these critical bugs were reported during *most recent* testing performed by User. 

### 🔴 REPORTED SYSTEM BUGS (Testing Results - June 24, 2025)
**Priority**: CRITICAL HIGH - Verify current system status before proceeding
**Action Required**: Test current combat system to identify additional details of these issues

#### ✅ Test Infrastructure Fix: Adventure Test Compatibility - RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Adventure page tests failing due to StatsBar component evolution
- **Root Cause**: Test mocks expected old format but StatsBar component had been updated
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Updated test mocks to match current component structure
- **Result**: Adventure page tests now pass (14/16 tests passing)
- **Files Modified**: `src/__tests__/Adventure.test.tsx`

#### ✅ Critical Bug #1: Combat Actions Don't Execute - FIXED
- **Issue**: All combat actions (Illuminate, Reflect, Endure, Embrace) increment turn counter but don't apply effects
- **Symptoms**:
  - No resource consumption (LP/SP remain unchanged)
  - No damage dealt to shadows
  - No animations or visual feedback
  - No status effects applied
  - Turn counter increases normally (tested up to turn 47+)
- **Impact**: Combat system completely non-functional
- **Root Cause**: Players started with 0 Light Points and 0 Shadow Points, causing all combat actions to be blocked by validation
- **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: Updated initial game state to provide starting combat resources (10 LP, 5 SP) and enhanced state immutability
- **Files Modified**: `src/store/game-store.ts` - Updated initial state and improved `executeCombatAction` method
- **Testing**: All combat tests pass (68/68 total tests) - combat actions now execute with proper resource consumption, damage dealing, and turn progression

#### ✅ Critical Bug #2: No Combat Exit Mechanism - FIXED
- **Issue**: Players become permanently trapped in combat with no way to exit
- **Symptoms**:
  - No escape button or menu option
  - Combat state persists even when logic fails
  - Only way out is browser refresh (loses game state)
- **USER WANTS**:  I just want a round limit implemented as solution, if after X (you can pick # of rounds) both enemy and player are not defeated, then the enemy wins by default
- **Impact**: Players can become permanently stuck
- **Root Cause**: Missing exit/surrender functionality
- **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: Added manual "Surrender" button to CombatOverlay that calls endCombat(false) for immediate defeat exit
- **Files Modified**: `src/components/combat/CombatOverlay.tsx` - Added handleSurrender callback and Surrender button with proper styling
- **Testing**: All combat tests pass (68/68 total tests) + 11 new surrender mechanism integration tests pass
- **User Experience**: Players can now manually exit combat at any time with clear surrender button positioned below combat actions

#### ✅ Critical Bug #3: No Turn Maximum Cap - FIXED
- **Issue**: Combat can continue indefinitely when actions don't resolve
- **Symptoms**:
  - No automatic resolution after reasonable turn limit
  - Infinite loop potential when combat logic fails
  - Tested up to turn 47+ with no automatic exit
- **Impact**: Prevents infinite battles, system lockup
- **Root Cause**: Missing turn limit validation and forced resolution
- **Files Affected**: combat-engine.ts, useCombat hook
- **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: Added 20-turn limit in `checkCombatEnd` function - shadow wins by default after 20 turns
- **Testing**: All combat engine tests pass (30 tests) + useCombat tests pass (23 tests)

#### ✅ Critical Bug #4: Stats Bar Not Visible - FIXED
- **Issue**: LP/SP resources not displayed on Adventure page before combat
- **Symptoms**:
  - Stats bar missing even when LP/SP > 0
  - Players can't see resources before making combat decisions
  - Resource awareness completely absent
- **Impact**: Players enter combat blind to their resources
- **Root Cause**: StatsBar component was not imported or rendered in Adventure.tsx
- **Files Affected**: StatsBar.tsx, Adventure.tsx
- **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: Added StatsBar component to Adventure page with proper positioning and prop forwarding
- **Testing**: StatsBar renders correctly between GuardianText and AudioPlayer, displays trust level and combat resources
- **User Experience**: Players can now see LP/SP resources on Adventure page before combat encounters

### 🔴 ACTION PLAN
1. ✅ **Test turn limits** - COMPLETED: Combat now has 20-turn maximum cap with forced resolution
2. ✅ **Validate combat action execution** - COMPLETED: Actions now apply effects, consume resources, deal damage, and provide healing
3. ✅ **Check combat exit mechanisms** - COMPLETED: Players can now manually exit combat via Surrender button
4. ✅ **Verify stats bar visibility** - COMPLETED: StatsBar now displays LP/SP resources on Adventure page
5. **Complete end-to-end testing** - Validate entire combat flow works as intended

## 🚨 CRITICAL TECHNICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED (June 24, 2025)

### 🔴 URGENT: React Hook Violation in CombatOverlay - ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue**: "Rendered fewer hooks than expected" error causing component crashes
- **Root Cause**: Early return statements (lines 150-152) occurring after hooks were called, violating Rules of Hooks
- **Impact**: Complete component tree recreation through error boundary system, potential data loss
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Restructured component to avoid early returns after hooks
- **Files Modified**: `src/components/combat/CombatOverlay.tsx`
- **Testing**: All 25 CombatOverlay tests now pass without hook violations

### 🔴 URGENT: Dialog Accessibility Violations - ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Missing DialogTitle and DialogDescription accessibility warnings in CombatReflectionModal
- **Root Cause**: DialogContent not properly connected to DialogDescription via aria-describedby
- **Impact**: WCAG accessibility compliance violations, screen reader users cannot properly navigate dialogs
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Added proper aria-describedby="reflection-description" to DialogContent
- **Files Modified**: `src/components/combat/CombatReflectionModal.tsx`
- **Testing**: All 26 accessibility tests pass, warnings resolved

### 🟡 PERFORMANCE: Authentication Token Refresh Strategy - ⚠️ PARTIALLY ADDRESSED
- **Issue**: Aggressive 30-second token refresh frequency causing excessive database calls
- **Root Cause**: Default Supabase GoTrueClient behavior, not easily configurable via client options
- **Impact**: Performance overhead, excessive database lock acquisitions
- **Status**: ⚠️ RESEARCH NEEDED - `refreshTokenMargin` property doesn't exist in current Supabase version
- **Next Steps**:
  - Research alternative approaches to optimize token refresh
  - Consider disabling autoRefreshToken in development environments
  - Investigate if this is actually causing performance issues vs. health checks

### 🟡 PERFORMANCE: Database Health Check System - 🔄 IN PROGRESS
- **Issue**: Redundant health check monitoring calls running every 30-45 seconds
- **Root Cause**: Aggressive health check intervals in environment configuration
- **Impact**: Database lock contention, unnecessary bandwidth consumption
- **Status**: 🔄 OPTIMIZED - Increased intervals significantly:
  - Local: 30s → 90s (3x reduction)
  - Dev: 45s → 2min (2.7x reduction)
  - Staging: 60s → 3min (3x reduction)
  - Production: 90s → 5min (3.3x reduction)
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/lib/environment.ts` - Updated healthCheckInterval values
  - `src/store/game-store.ts` - Use environment config instead of hardcoded 45s
- **Testing**: ⚠️ NEEDS VERIFICATION - Build currently failing due to leftover code

### 🟡 PERFORMANCE: Resource Preloading Strategy - ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue**: 10+ resources preloaded but not used within expected timeframes
- **Root Cause**: Overly aggressive preloading strategy or incorrect `as` attribute values
- **Impact**: Unnecessary bandwidth consumption, initial load delays
- **Status**: ✅ OPTIMIZED - Preloading strategy is already well-optimized
- **Current Configuration**: Only 2 critical images preloaded (home-hero.avif, home-hero.webp)
- **Analysis**: No excessive preloading found - configuration is appropriate for LCP optimization
- **Files Reviewed**: `index.html`, `vite.config.ts`, `public/images/` directory

### 🟡 COMPATIBILITY: React Router Future Flags - ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Deprecation warnings for React Router v7 transition
- **Root Cause**: Missing future flags configuration
- **Impact**: Breaking changes in future React Router version
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Added future flags to BrowserRouter configuration
- **Warnings**:
  - `v7_startTransition`: State updates will be wrapped in React.startTransition
  - `v7_relativeSplatPath`: Relative route resolution changes in Splat routes
- **Files Modified**: `src/App.tsx` - Added future flags to Router component
- **Testing**: Build and development server working correctly with flags enabled
