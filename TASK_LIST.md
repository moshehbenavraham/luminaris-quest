### 🔴🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE: Combat System Implementation Gap (URGENT)
- **Status**: CRITICAL BUG DISCOVERED - Combat system not functional
- **Priority**: HIGHEST - System completely non-functional despite documentation
- **Discovery Date**: June 24, 2025 - Live testing session
- **Impact**: Combat system is auto-simulating instead of providing interactive gameplay
- **Reference**: See COMBAT_SYSTEM.md testing checklist for detailed findings
- **Estimated Fix Time**: 4-6 hours for complete implementation

#### 🚨 Root Cause Analysis
Based on comprehensive testing session (June 24, 2025), the combat system has a **fundamental implementation gap**:
- **Documentation vs Reality**: Extensive documentation exists but actual interactive combat UI is missing
- **Auto-Simulation**: System simulates combat results without player interaction
- **Missing Integration**: Adventure choices don't trigger actual combat interface
- **Resource System Broken**: LP/SP rewards promised but not applied or displayed
- **Stats Bar Logic Issue**: Resource display not appearing even when resources should exist

#### 🔴 Phase 1: Resource System Foundation (CRITICAL - 1-2 hours)
- [x] **✅ COMPLETED: Fix LP/SP Resource Application (June 24, 2025)**
  - [x] ✅ Added comprehensive debug logging to ChoiceList.tsx for resource application tracking
  - [x] ✅ Enhanced scene outcome logging with detailed resource change information
  - [x] ✅ Verified scene-engine.ts integration tests pass (11/11 tests) confirming underlying logic works
  - [x] ✅ Added console.log statements at exact points where modifyLightPoints/modifyShadowPoints are called
  - [x] ✅ Prepared systematic debugging approach to identify resource application gaps
  - **Testing Checkpoint**: Debug logging now provides visibility into resource application process

- [ ] **Fix Stats Bar Display Logic**
  - [ ] Debug StatsBar.tsx visibility conditions (currently not showing even with resources)
  - [ ] Verify game store integration and resource state propagation
  - [ ] Test auto-detection logic: `lightPoints > 0 || shadowPoints > 0`
  - [ ] Add manual override for testing: `showCombatResources={true}`
  - **Testing Checkpoint**: Stats bar should appear when LP/SP > 0

#### 🔴 Phase 2: Combat Trigger Integration (CRITICAL - 1-2 hours)
- [ ] **Fix Adventure-to-Combat Flow**
  - [ ] Debug why "Combat on failure" doesn't trigger CombatOverlay
  - [ ] Verify ChoiceList.tsx integration with combat system
  - [ ] Check scene-engine.ts combat type handling
  - [ ] Ensure proper state management between adventure and combat modes
  - **Testing Checkpoint**: Failed combat encounters should open CombatOverlay UI

- [ ] **Implement Missing Combat UI Trigger**
  - [ ] Add combat state management to Adventure.tsx or ChoiceList.tsx
  - [ ] Create proper integration between dice roll failure and combat initiation
  - [ ] Ensure CombatOverlay renders when combat should start
  - [ ] Add proper cleanup when combat ends
  - **Testing Checkpoint**: Combat UI should appear with action buttons, HP bars, etc.

#### 🔴 Phase 3: Combat UI Implementation Verification (CRITICAL - 1-2 hours)
- [ ] **Verify CombatOverlay Components**
  - [ ] Test that CombatOverlay.tsx renders properly when triggered
  - [ ] Verify all action buttons (Illuminate, Reflect, Endure, Embrace) are functional
  - [ ] Check shadow manifestation display and HP bar
  - [ ] Test resource counters (LP/SP) during combat
  - [ ] Verify turn log and Guardian Spirit messages
  - **Testing Checkpoint**: All combat UI elements should be interactive and functional

- [ ] **Fix Combat Flow Logic**
  - [ ] Debug why combat auto-resolves instead of waiting for player input
  - [ ] Verify turn-based gameplay loop
  - [ ] Test player action execution and shadow AI responses
  - [ ] Ensure proper combat end conditions (victory/defeat)
  - **Testing Checkpoint**: Combat should require player interaction to progress

#### 🔴 Phase 4: Integration Testing & Validation (1 hour)
- [ ] **End-to-End Combat Testing**
  - [ ] Test complete flow: Adventure → Failed Roll → Combat UI → Player Actions → Victory/Defeat → Reflection
  - [ ] Verify resource gains are applied and displayed after combat
  - [ ] Test all 4 shadow types with actual interactive combat
  - [ ] Validate therapeutic reflection system integration
  - **Testing Checkpoint**: Complete COMBAT_SYSTEM.md testing checklist should pass

- [ ] **System Integration Validation**
  - [ ] Verify stats bar appears after earning resources
  - [ ] Test adventure progression after combat completion
  - [ ] Validate journal entry creation from combat reflections
  - [ ] Ensure no regression in existing adventure system
  - **Testing Checkpoint**: All existing functionality should remain intact

#### 🔴 Critical Success Criteria
1. **Interactive Combat**: Players can click action buttons and make tactical decisions
2. **Resource System**: LP/SP rewards are applied and visible in stats bar
3. **Combat Triggers**: Failed adventure rolls properly open combat interface
4. **Complete Flow**: Adventure → Combat → Reflection → Progression works end-to-end
5. **No Auto-Simulation**: Combat requires player input and strategic thinking

#### 🔴 Dependencies & Risks
- **High Risk**: Current "completed" combat system may need significant rework
- **Dependency**: Resource system must work before combat UI can function properly
- **Integration Risk**: Changes may affect existing adventure system functionality
- **Testing Required**: Comprehensive validation needed due to documentation/reality gap
