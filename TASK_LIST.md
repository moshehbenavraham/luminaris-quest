# Luminari's Quest - Task List


## CRITICAL: Combat System Issues - In Combat Overlay

**these are issues directly writtten/reported by User**

### âœ… the combat overlay is dark and some of the text is too dark making it impossible to see, the text must be lighter - specific text include "Resources" and "Choose Your Response" - COMPLETED 2025-06-26
### [SKIP THIS FOR NOW, FAILED TOO MANY FIX ATTEMPTS HORRIFIC TIME DRAIN] visual strip appearing at the top of combat overlay -- the combat overlay (combat mode) turns the background blurry and that blur doesn't seem to fill the full screen, i think that is what is causing the strip - FIXES ATTEMPTED AND FAILED 2025-06-26
### combat overlay does not deal with resizing well at all (seems to not have been developed with "mobile-first" approach despite that being a rule), only looks decent in full desktop mode
### there is no signs at all the opponent is getting a turn at all UNLESS i hit the 'end turn' button (end turn button is meant to just be used if you are stuck or want to skip your own turn)
### âœ… 'end turn' button is supposed to be next to the 'surrender' button in the combat overlay (right now its in the "Choose Your Response" section) - COMPLETED 2025-06-26
