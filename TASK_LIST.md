### Phase 3: Create Database Tables

## üöÄ Quick Start Priority Tasks

If you need to get unstuck immediately, focus on these critical tasks first:

1. **Document environment setup** (Phase 1.3)
2. **Create minimal `game_states` table** (Phase 3.1) 
3. **Deploy to local environment first** (Phase 4.1)
4. **Generate TypeScript types** (Phase 5.1)
5. **Add basic error handling** (Phase 6.3)

This should resolve the React error #185 and allow basic functionality while you complete the remaining tasks across all environments.

## üåç Environment Deployment Order

**Recommended deployment sequence:**
1. **Local** ‚Üí Develop and test migrations
2. **Development** ‚Üí Integration testing with team
3. **Staging** ‚Üí Pre-production validation
4. **Production** ‚Üí Final deployment with monitoring
