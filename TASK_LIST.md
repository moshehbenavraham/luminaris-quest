## üö® URGENT: APPLICATION CRASH FIX CHECKLIST (Added: 2025-06-16 13:00 UTC+3)

### üî• CRITICAL - Infinite Loop Causing Application Crashes

**Status:** PARTIALLY FIXED - Partial Set stability implemented, but crash persists
**Root Cause:** Multi-part feedback loop: Set reference recreation + setTimeout chain + modal state dependencies
**Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive, "Maximum update depth exceeded" React error

- [x] **C1: Fix Set Reference Recreation in Game Store** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY COMPLETED 2025-06-16 19:30
  - [x] **C1.1**: Review [`game-store.ts`](src/store/game-store.ts) `updateMilestone()` function (line ~290-318) ‚úÖ
    - Issue: `new Set(state.pendingMilestoneJournals)` creates unstable reference every call
    - Fix: Added conditional Set creation - only creates new Set when milestones will actually be achieved
  - [x] **C1.2**: Review [`game-store.ts`](src/store/game-store.ts) `markMilestoneJournalShown()` function (line ~324-334) ‚úÖ
    - Issue: `new Set(state.pendingMilestoneJournals)` creates unstable reference every call
    - Fix: Added conditional Set creation - only creates new Set when level exists in pending set
  - [x] **C1.3**: Implement stable Set update pattern ‚úÖ
    - Returns empty object (no state change) when no actual changes needed
    - Preserves Set reference stability when contents unchanged
    - Added comprehensive diagnostic logging for validation
  - **RESULT**: Partial fix implemented but insufficient - crash persists due to additional feedback loops

- [ ] **C2: Fix Adventure.tsx useCallback Dependency Chain** ‚ö†Ô∏è IDENTIFIED BUT NOT FIXED
  - [x] **C2.1**: Review [`Adventure.tsx`](src/pages/Adventure.tsx) `checkForNewMilestones` useCallback (line ~61) ‚úÖ
    - Issue: Depends on `[showJournalModal, pendingMilestoneJournals]` - both can trigger recreation
    - Analysis: Even with Set stability, modal state changes still trigger callback recreation
  - [x] **C2.2**: Review setTimeout chain in modal onClose (line ~166-169) ‚úÖ
    - Issue: `setTimeout(checkForNewMilestones, 100)` creates infinite feedback loop
    - Analysis: setTimeout fires with recreated callback reference, perpetuating the cycle
  - [ ] **C2.3**: Add dependency stabilization **REQUIRED FOR COMPLETE FIX**
    - Remove setTimeout chain or break feedback loop
    - Stabilize useCallback dependencies
    - Consolidate duplicate milestone checking logic (duplicate useEffect on line ~72-100)
  - **RESULT**: Root cause fully identified - requires architectural changes to break feedback loops

### üö® HIGH PRIORITY - Database & Network Errors

**Status:** ACTIVE ERRORS - 404 responses causing repeated failures
**Impact:** Data not saving, error spam in console

- [ ] **H1: Fix game_states Endpoint 404 Errors**
  - [ ] **H1.1**: Verify [`game_states`](src/integrations/supabase/types.ts) table exists in Supabase
    - Check Supabase dashboard for table presence
    - Verify table name matches code expectations exactly
  - [ ] **H1.2**: Check API URL configuration in [`supabase client`](src/integrations/supabase/client.ts)
    - Verify SUPABASE_URL environment variable
    - Check endpoint path construction
  - [ ] **H1.3**: Review Row Level Security (RLS) policies
    - Ensure authenticated users can access their own game_states
    - Test RLS policies with current authentication setup
    - Check [`test_migration_validation.sql`](test_migration_validation.sql) for RLS validation

- [ ] **H2: Database Connection Health Monitoring**
  - [ ] **H2.1**: Implement connection health check in [`use-database-health.ts`](src/hooks/use-database-health.ts)
  - [ ] **H2.2**: Add error boundary for database operations
  - [ ] **H2.3**: Implement retry logic for transient failures

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY - Accessibility & UX Issues

**Status:** WARNINGS - Impacting accessibility and user experience
**Impact:** Screen reader accessibility, potential confusion

- [ ] **M1: Fix DialogContent Accessibility Warnings**
  - [ ] **M1.1**: Add DialogTitle to all Dialog components
    - Review [`JournalModal.tsx`](src/components/JournalModal.tsx)
    - Add VisuallyHidden wrapper if title should be hidden
  - [ ] **M1.2**: Add DialogDescription or aria-describedby
    - Provide context for screen readers
    - Ensure all modals have proper ARIA labels

- [ ] **M2: Fix Duplicate GoTrueClient Warning**
  - [ ] **M2.1**: Review [`supabase client`](src/integrations/supabase/client.ts) initialization
  - [ ] **M2.2**: Ensure singleton pattern for Supabase client
  - [ ] **M2.3**: Check for multiple provider instances in [`supabase-provider.tsx`](src/lib/providers/supabase-provider.tsx)

### üìù LOW PRIORITY - Code Quality & Future Compatibility

**Status:** WARNINGS - Non-critical but should be addressed
**Impact:** Future compatibility and development experience

- [ ] **L1: Address React Router v7 Future Flags**
  - [ ] **L1.1**: Update router configuration with v7 flags
    - `v7_startTransition: true`
    - `v7_relativeSplatPath: true`
  - [ ] **L1.2**: Test routing behavior with new flags

- [ ] **L2: Investigate Duplicate Journal Entry Prevention**
  - [ ] **L2.1**: Review journal entry logic in [`game-store.ts`](src/store/game-store.ts)
  - [ ] **L2.2**: Understand why `addJournalEntry` is called multiple times
  - [ ] **L2.3**: Optimize to prevent unnecessary calls (likely related to infinite loop)

### üß™ VALIDATION & TESTING CHECKLIST

- [ ] **V1: Crash Fix Validation**
  - [x] **V1.1**: Add diagnostic logs to validate infinite loop theory ‚úÖ 2025-06-16 19:30

    - Confirmed exact infinite loop pattern: Set recreation ‚Üí callback recreation ‚Üí setTimeout chain
  - [ ] **V1.2**: Test Adventure page interaction without crashes **FAILS - Still crashes**
  - [ ] **V1.3**: Verify no "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors **FAILS - Error persists**
  - [ ] **V1.4**: Confirm modal open/close cycles work properly **FAILS - Triggers infinite loop**
  - **STATUS**: Diagnostic phase complete, but full fix still required

- [ ] **V2: Database Operation Testing**
  - [ ] **V2.1**: Test game state saving/loading
  - [ ] **V2.2**: Test journal entry creation
  - [ ] **V2.3**: Verify no 404 errors in console
