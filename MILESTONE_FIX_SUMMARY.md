# Milestone Journal Infinite Loop Fix Summary

## The Problem
The milestone journal feature was stuck in an infinite loop due to over-engineered state management:
1. When trust level changed, it would update milestones
2. This would create a new Set instance for `pendingMilestoneJournals` (even when nothing changed)
3. The new Set reference would trigger React dependency changes
4. This would re-create the `checkForNewMilestones` callback
5. Which would trigger another check... creating an infinite loop

## The Solution

### 1. Fixed Reference Stability in game-store.ts
- `updateMilestone`: Only creates new Set when actually adding new levels
- `markMilestoneJournalShown`: Returns same state reference when no change needed
- Removed unnecessary console.log statements

### 2. Simplified Adventure.tsx
- Removed complex `checkForNewMilestones` callback with circuit breakers
- Removed throttling logic (CHECK_THROTTLE_MS, MAX_CHECKS_PER_MINUTE)
- Replaced with simple useEffect that checks pendingMilestoneJournals
- Removed all refs that were trying to prevent loops

### 3. Cleaned up JournalModal.tsx
- Removed `hasBeenSaved` state that was causing complexity
- Simplified to just save when modal opens
- Removed setTimeout in close handler

### 4. Removed Auto-Save Cascade
- Disabled automatic `saveToSupabase()` calls after journal operations
- This prevents cascading saves that could trigger more state updates

## Result
The milestone journal feature is now simple and reliable:
- Check if milestone reached → Show modal → Save entry → Mark as shown
- No infinite loops, no complex state management, no band-aid fixes

## Testing
Run `npm run dev` and:
1. Change trust level to trigger a milestone (25, 50, or 75)
2. Journal modal should appear once
3. After closing, it shouldn't reappear for the same milestone
4. No console errors or warnings about rapid state updates
